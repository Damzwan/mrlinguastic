        <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Mr LingWhat?</h4>
        <p class="flow-text">Mr Linguastic is a language learning platform created by 2 students during the corona
          lockdown.
          Our goal is to create a community driven platform where people can study multiple areas of a language.</p>

        <p class="flow-text">
          Instead of wasting time searching for good sources for every subject individually, we would like to create a
          platform where everything is united.
        </p>

        <p class="flow-text">
          Imagine finding reading or listening material recommended by other students without wasting so much time on
          the searching part,
          importing vocabulary and irregular verb lists created by teachers or even chatting with fellow students in
          the language that you would like to learn.
        </p>

        <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Great! But what will it cost?</h4>
        <p class="flow-text">We strongly believe in <b>free</b> education! We hope to create an ad-free website with
          no premium nonsense. Donations are most certainly appreciated.
        </p>

        <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Future</h4>
        <p class="flow-text">This is only the beginning! This project was created during our free time while also
          focusing on our university studies. Currently the platform only supports Vocabulary training but we would like
          to extend this step by step.
        </p>
