        <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">LLN What?</h4>
        <p class="flow-text">LLN is a language learning website created by 2 students during the corona lockdown.
          Our goal is to create a community driven language learning platform where people can study
          multiple components of a language.</p>

        <p class="flow-text">Instead of wasting time searching for a great source for vocabulary, grammer or
          listening, we would like to create a website where everything is united.
        </p>

        <p class="flow-text">
          Imagine instantly finding reading or listening material recommended by other students without wasting so much time on the searching part.
          Importing vocabulary and irregular verb lists created by teachers or even chatting with fellow students in
          the language that you would like to learn.
        </p>

        <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Great! But what will it cost?</h4>
        <p class="flow-text">We strongly believe in <b>free</b> education! We hope to create an ad-free website with
          no premium nonsense. Donations are most certainly appreciated.
        </p>

        <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Future</h4>
        <p class="flow-text">This is only the beginning! This project was created during our free time and we would love to continue :)
        </p>
